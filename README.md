About the Project
The DriverPass project was created for a client who wanted a system to help students get ready for their DMV driving tests. The system needed to let students take online practice tests, watch lessons, and schedule driving sessions with instructors. It also had to help staff and IT manage accounts, schedules, and progress reports. The goal was to make learning to drive easier, safer, and more organized.

What I Did Well
I did well explaining what the system should do and making the requirements clear. I made sure the design focused on students’ needs and kept things simple and easy to understand. I also made sure to include security and updates, so the system stays current with DMV rules. My diagrams and models showed how students, instructors, and admins all connect within the system.

What I Would Improve
If I could improve one part, I’d make the project timeline and Gantt chart more detailed. I would add clearer steps for testing and deadlines to help plan the work better. This would make it easier for the team to stay on track and manage time.

Understanding the User’s Needs
I focused on what the client and students actually needed—easy access to lessons, progress tracking, and current DMV information. I turned those needs into system features like scheduling lessons online and taking practice exams anywhere. It’s important to focus on the user because if the system doesn’t fit what they need, they won’t want to use it.

My Design Approach
When I design software, I start by learning what the users want and then plan how the system should work step by step. I use diagrams and models to picture how data moves and how users interact with the system. In the future, I’ll keep using these methods to make sure systems are clear, well-organized, and easy for people to use.
